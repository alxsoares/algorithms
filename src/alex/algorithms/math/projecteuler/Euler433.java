	 * For the first part of this discussion, let "pair" mean a pair of integers
	 * (x, y) where x > y >= 0. No other kind of pair will be considered.
	 * 
	 * For a given pair (x, y) such that y > 0, one step of Euclid's algorithm
	 * produces a new pair (y, z) where z = x mod y, so y > z >= 0. Note that
	 * each pair (x, 0) has no next step using Euclid's algorithm. With these
	 * two facts, we can see that Euclid's algorithm causes the set of all pairs
	 * to form an implicit directed graph - in fact, a directed forest. (For
	 * example, one path in the forest is (10, 6) -> (6, 4) -> (4, 2) -> (2,
	 * 0).)
	 * 
	 * To find all the pairs (x, y) that produce a given pair (y, z), we can
	 * compute all the possible ways to take one reverse step of Euclid's
	 * algorithm. z = x mod y implies x = z + ky. To ensure that x > y, if z = 0
	 * then we need k >= 2, otherwise we need k >= 1.
	 * 
	 * When we take such a reverse step, we keep a count of how many steps were
	 * taken. For example: - (1, 0): 0 step (root) - (2, 1): 1 step from root;
	 * (1, 0) with k=2 yields 0 + 2*1 = 2 - (3, 1): 1 step from root; (1, 0)
	 * with k=3 yields 0 + 3*1 = 3 - (4, 1): 1 step from root; (1, 0) with k=4
	 * yields 0 + 4*1 = 4 - (3, 2): 2 steps from root; (2, 1) with k=1 yields 1
	 * + 1*2 = 3 - (13, 3): 3 steps from root; (3, 2) with k=5 yields 3 + 5*2 =
	 * 13
	 * 
	 * To explore the pairs, we start from each root (z, 0) (where z >= 1) and
	 * use depth-first search by reverse stepping until x > LIMIT, at which
	 * point the pair (and any deeper ones) is outside of the range of the
	 * problem statement. Because Euclid's algorithm ensures that repeated
	 * forward stepping on any pair will lead to a root, this aforementioned
	 * reverse stepping search will necessarily visit every pair exactly once.
	 * 
	 * Now to account for the other "pairs" (x, y) where it is not the case that
	 * x > y >= 0 (i.e. x <= y or y < 0): - If y < 0: y is clearly outside the
	 * range of the problem statement. - Assume x > 0, to stay in the range of
	 * the problem statement. - If x = y: E(x, x) = 1, since (x, x) -> (x, 0). -
	 * If x < y: E(x, y) = E(y, x) + 1, since (x, y) -> (y, x), where y > x > 0.
	 * 
	 * If we have computed s = sum of E(x, y) for all 1 <= y < x <= LIMIT by
	 * using reverse stepping search, then: - The sum of E(x, x) for all 1 <= x
	 * <= LIMIT is LIMIT. - The sum of E(x, y) for all 1 <= x < y <= LIMIT is
	 * equal to the sum of E(y, x) + 1 for all 1 <= x < y <= LIMIT = the sum of
	 * E(x, y) + 1 for all 1 <= y < x <= LIMIT = s + 1 * (number of summands) =
	 * (1 + 2 + ... + (LIMIT-1)) = s + LIMIT*(LIMIT-1)/2.
	 * 
	 * Therefore the final sum we want is s + (s + LIMIT*(LIMIT-1)/2) + LIMIT =
	 * 2s + LIMIT*(LIMIT+1)/2.
	 * 
	 * Note: For LIMIT = 5000000, why does the final sum fit in a 'long' (int64)
	 * variable? Without proof, Fibonacci numbers result in the largest value of
	 * E(x, y). Namely, let x = F(n) and y = F(n+1). Note that x < y. Then E(x,
	 * y) is larger than any other E(x', y') where x', y' <= y. The smallest
	 * Fibonacci number that is at least as large as LIMIT is F(34) = 5702887.
	 * We can compute that E(F(33), F(34)) = 33. So we know for all 1 <= x, y <=
	 * LIMIT < F(34), we have E(x, y) < 33. Therefore the sum of E(x, y) for all
	 * 1 <= x, y <= LIMIT is less than 33 * LIMIT^2 ~= 2^49.55, which is less
	 * than 63 bits.
